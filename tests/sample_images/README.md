Sample / Test Deconvolution Images
==================================

Use this directory to store sample or test images for deconvolution. Note that
they are *NOT* supposed to be committed into the repository, this is simply
intended as a standardized place to keep them (e.g. for automatic testing).

The basic set of images can be downloaded from the SVI website (an account is
required though): https://svi.nl/DemoImages
