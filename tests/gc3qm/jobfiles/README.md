Jobfiles
========

Directory layout:

sandbox
-------

This directory is meant to hold sample files (job descriptions, huygens
templates) for testing purposes during development. Therefore it can sometimes
contain out-of-date information.


input
-----

Files for automatic testing should be placed in here. In a later step,
automated tests should be run against this directory to prevent outdated
information.

input-old
---------

Jobfiles in an outdated version should be moved here to keep them for reference
and comparing.
